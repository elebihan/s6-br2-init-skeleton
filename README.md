# s6-br2-init-skeleton: skeleton for Buildroot systems with s6 as init

## Overview

This project provides all the files needed to use an init system based on
[s6](http://skarnet.org/software/s6/) and
[s6-rc](http://skarnet.org/software/s6-rc/) in
[Buildroot](https://buildroot.org) embedded systems, instead of systemd or SysV.
